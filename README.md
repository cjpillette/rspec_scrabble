# SCORE SCRABBLE USING USING RSPEC

This simple app illustrates how to write test driven development program, the continuous ballet between the testing side of the app (spec) and the actual app code (lib).

After you've cloned this repo (or downloaded it to your computer),

```
cd Scrabble
```

Then open it with your favourite text editor (in my case atom)

```
atom .
```

# INTERACTING WITH THE APP

To run the app, in your terminal type:
```
$ ruby play_the_game
```

To run the rspec tests, in your terminal simply type:

```
$ rspec
```
